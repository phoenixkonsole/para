**Para Token (PARA) Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Token Launch and Distribution**
- Deploy BEP20 smart contract with the address: 0x8A5652EB940dD3832a8426FBe5afBB01b0f96a14.
- Distribute tokens to initial investors, team members, and partners as per the tokenomics plan.
- Launch on PancakeSwap or other relevant decentralized exchanges to ensure trading availability.

**Phase 2: Fee Mechanics Implementation**
- Implement transaction fees that are distributed among holders, added to liquidity, burned, and sent to a designated wallet.
- Set up a mechanism to automatically accumulate transaction fees in the token contract.
- Develop a batching system to execute fee transfers, burns, and liquidity adds in batches, triggered by specific conditions.

**Phase 3: Gas-Efficient Fee Execution**
- Introduce a mechanism where high gas fees are incurred only for a few sell transactions that trigger fee executions.
- Optimize and streamline the gas-efficient execution of fee transfers, burns, and liquidity additions.

**Phase 4: Use Case Integration**
- Integrate PARA into the TELOSCOIN and BitcoinSubsidium(XBTX) communities, combining developments and communities.
- Introduce initial use cases: taxation and anti-whale mechanisms built into the smart contract.

**Phase 5: Paraverse Projects**
1. **Bitstreams.tv Decentralization**: Launch a decentralized version of Bitstreams.tv, enabling users to monetize their channels and promote content using referral links. Expected release in 2023.
2. **PAPARA NFT App**: Revive the PAPARA NFT app based around PARA token, allowing users to mint, sell, and burn NFTs. Planned release in 2023.
3. **Parabellum Privacy Messenger and Filesharing**: Launch a decentralized, private messenger and file-sharing platform, enabling creation of private groups with optional crypto charges. Expected release in 2023.
4. **Kryptobay Decentralized Marketplace**: Revamp Kryptobay as a user-driven decentralized marketplace. Planned release in 2023.

**Phase 6: Community Expansion and Engagement**
- Engage with the community through social media, forums, and other platforms to foster awareness and adoption.
- Encourage user participation in the Paraverse projects and gather feedback for improvements.

**Phase 7: Paraverse Wallet and Cryptofriendly Banking**
- Provide a custom Wallet with Integrated Banking and virtual Creditcards 
  
**Phase 8: Continuous Development**
- Continuously improve fee mechanics, gas efficiency, and overall user experience.
- Explore additional partnerships, collaborations, and integrations to enhance the ecosystem.

Remember that a roadmap is a dynamic plan subject to adjustments based on market conditions, user feedback, and unforeseen challenges. It's important to maintain transparency and communication with the community throughout the project's development.
